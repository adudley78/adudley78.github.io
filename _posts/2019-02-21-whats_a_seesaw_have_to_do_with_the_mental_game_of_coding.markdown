I look at the mental game of coding like this...

On one side is fun! You're cruising along, in the zone, feeling capable. Yeah!

On the other side is frustration! You're stuck, ugly red errors staring you in the face, despair setting in. Bleh!

In some moments your seesaw is tipped to the fun side and in others it's tipped to the frustrating side. Sometimes the feeling might be neutral. 

I think you know coding is for you if you're willing to work through the frustration for the reward of fun when things start flowing again.
